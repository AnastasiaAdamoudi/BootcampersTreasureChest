# Bootcampers' Treasure chest

In Week 7 of my School of Code journey, I got to work on a team frontend project, addressing a common challenge faced by School of Code bootcampers.

### The challenge:
Bootcampers often found it challenging to access and categorize the plethora of learning and tech resources available to them.

### Our solution:
An app that streamlines these resources, categorizing them for easy access. We chose React to ensure code maintainability and reusability, while delving into MaterialUI to enhance the user experience and learn the application of a new library. Importantly, we prioritized web accessibility standards to ensure inclusivity.
